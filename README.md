# Designated Verifier ZKP

The designated verifier circuit is a pluggable component that can be included to **add a designated verifier** inside any zkSNARK. This means that the prover can choose the designated verifier. The prover will be able to convince only the designated verifier of the veracity of that proof. Everyone else accessing wouldn't be able to tell whether the proof was actually generated by the prover or forged by the designated verifer.

## Setup 

- Clone submodule
- Go into submodule
- Install the dependencies

## Key concept of Designated Verifier ZKproof

- [ ] Add explanation of the logic of the circuit "I prove that I know your private key or that I know X"

## Designated Verifier Signature ZKProof

- [ ] Add Miro illustration of circuit design

## Plug into your SNARK

- [ ] Add instructions about how to modify your current circuit to accomodate the SVZkp

## To do 

- [ ] Move function to support testing inside an utils folder 
- [ ] How can I access someone's publickey?
- [ ] Modify usage of message hash
- [ ] What is the sense of ff javascript?

Test #1 => Prover wants to communicate something to the designated verifier 

"I have a secret x". Sign the message and use it inside the zkSNARK. 

Test #2 => Designated verifier wants to share with other people the message sent him by the Prover 

Test #3 => Designated verifier wants to share with other people forging a false message sent him by the Prover
