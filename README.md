# selected-verifier-zkp

Pluggable circuit that can be included inside any zk-SNARK system to make it selectely verifiable. The prover would be able to select a designated verifier. 
If the designated verifier decides to share the proof with other parties, these wouldn't be able to tell whether the proof was actually generated by the proof or forged by the designated verifer.

Inspired by : 

- [Jordi Baylina - ZKP and SSI - Iden3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd6SMShk7-c&t=998s)
- [Markus Jakobsson - Designated Verifier Proofs and Their Applications paper](http://markus-jakobsson.com/papers/jakobsson-eurocrypt96.pdf)

## Key concept 

- [ ] Add explanation of the logic of the circuit "I prove that I know your private key or that I know X"

## Circuit Architecture 

- [ ] Add Miro illustration of circuit design

## Plug into your SNARK

`npm install package name`

- [ ] Add instructions about how to modify your current circuit to accomodate the SVZkp

## Tutorial

1) Add it to Merkle Tree Checker
2) Add it to Semaphore

## Error Handling


## To do 

- [ ] Add public input in circuit instantiation
- [ ] Further circuit testing
