Requirements of the CLI 

- [v] should have three commands - sign - genproof - verifyproof
- [ ] fix the path for where to save and fetch the json - they need to be specified inside the cli. Use file path - maybe just add the directory for everything! 
- [ ] help message to let you understand how to use that 
- [ ] Options can be put also after the arguments
- [ ] Need to download the files from amazon! Specify that! 
- [ ] Replace function in test with functions from utils. For signing message, there should be only one function!
- [ ] Benchmark the time to generate the proof on a laptop
